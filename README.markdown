# Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains a Python script implementing Q-learning for a simple grid world environment.

## Overview
The script defines a 4x4 grid world with a goal state, uses Q-learning to learn an optimal policy, and prints the best action for each state.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
Run the script to train and display the optimal policy:
```bash
python reinforcement_learning.py
```

## Output
- Grid showing the best action (first letter) for each state, with 'G' for the goal

## Note
Extend by adding obstacles or varying rewards for a more complex environment.
